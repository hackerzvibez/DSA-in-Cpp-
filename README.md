# DSA-in-C++-
**DSA in C++**
This repository contains my practice programs and implementations for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. I am using *Problem Solving in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++* by Hemant Jain as my guide.

The repo includes:

* Implementations of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
* Common algorithmic problems and their solutions
* Practice exercises from the book with my personal solutions and explanations
* Clean and well-commented C++ code for learning and reference

This repo is meant for:

* Beginners who want to learn DSA step by step
* Anyone looking for practical C++ implementations of standard algorithms
* Self-study and revision of DSA concepts

If you want, I can also draft a **shorter version** that’s perfect for the “Description” field on GitHub, while keeping the detailed one for the README. Do you want me to do that?
